# Substrate REST API

This repository is an experimental rewrite of the [substrate-api-sidecar](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-api-sidecar) in Rust. The project is fully experimental, and nothing here is guaranteed to work or remain stable.

## About

The goal of this project is to explore building a RESTful API for Substrate-based blockchains using Rust. It's intended as a fun side project and a learning experience for myself.

## Status

⚠️ **Experimental**: This project is in its very early stages. Expect incomplete functionality, breaking changes, and plenty of rough edges.

## Features

- A REST API to interact with Substrate-based blockchains.
- Written entirely in Rust for performance and reliability.
- Focusing on replicating functionality provided by substrate-api-sidecar.

## Usage

Since this is a personal experiment, no official usage instructions or pre-built binaries are provided. Clone the repository and explore the code if you're curious.
